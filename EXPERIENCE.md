# Workshop Experience: AI-Powered Full-Stack Development

## Overview

We conducted a hands-on workshop demonstrating the power of AI-assisted development using Cursor IDE. The workshop showcased how students could rapidly build full-stack applications with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs).

**Duration**: 1 hour  
**Participants**: 28 registered students  
**Demographics**: Primarily Khoury College students, with representation from the College of Engineering and College of Professional Studies

## Workshop Structure

### Phase 1: API Discovery and Analysis
1. **Resource Provision**: Students were provided with URLs for both the deployed client and server on Render:
   - **Server**: [https://cursorworkshopserver.onrender.com/](https://cursorworkshopserver.onrender.com/)
   - **Client**: [https://cursorworkshopclient.onrender.com/](https://cursorworkshopclient.onrender.com/)
2. **API Exploration**: Students were instructed to use the LLM to:
   - Generate CURL commands for testing the server endpoints
   - Analyze the published API structure and functionality
3. **Documentation**: Students created comprehensive `API_SPECIFICATION.md` documents based on their analysis

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
Students were tasked with implementing a new local backend server. The cloud-deployed client was configured to support `localhost:8080`, enabling seamless integration with local development.

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
Students built frontend applications that would communicate with their backend implementations, creating complete full-stack solutions.

## Results and Timeline

### 20 Minutes: First Frontends Emerge
Within the first third of the workshop, we began seeing the first frontend implementations:
- **Primary Technologies**: JavaScript and TypeScript dominated the implementations
- **Notable Exception**: One student chose Python for their frontend approach
- **Speed**: The rapid development showcased the effectiveness of AI-assisted coding

### 40 Minutes: First Full-Stack Success
By the two-thirds mark, we celebrated the first complete full-stack application running locally, demonstrating the end-to-end integration of frontend and backend components.

### Final 20 Minutes: Celebration and Momentum
The workshop's final phase was characterized by:
- **Increased Energy**: Notable uptick in room enthusiasm and engagement
- **Multiple Completions**: More students achieving their full-stack implementations
- **Collaborative Atmosphere**: Students sharing successes and helping each other

## Key Observations

### Student Engagement
- High participation rate across all college demographics
- Strong collaborative spirit, particularly in the final phase
- Effective use of AI tools to overcome technical barriers quickly

### Technical Outcomes
- Diverse technology choices while maintaining interoperability
- Rapid prototyping and iteration cycles
- Successful local deployment and testing

### Learning Outcomes
- Students experienced the complete development lifecycle in a compressed timeframe
- Demonstrated proficiency in API integration and full-stack architecture
- Gained hands-on experience with AI-assisted development workflows

## Future Plans

Building on this success, we're planning expanded workshops featuring:
- **Team-Based Development**: Students working in collaborative teams
- **Larger Scale Projects**: More ambitious and complex applications
- **Public Deployment**: Components contributing to a larger system with public proof-of-concept deployment
- **Extended Timeline**: Allowing for more sophisticated implementations and deeper learning
